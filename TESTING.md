# WEIGHT UP Gym - Testing Details

[Main README.md File](https://github.com/shaun-davies/weight-up/blob/master/README.md)

## Testing

- [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/)
-- The developer used W3C CSS Validation Service and W3C Markup Validation Service to check the validity of the website code.

The HTML Validator initially found 2 errors in the code:

1. *Error: Element ul not allowed as child of element h3 in this context.* 
- This was fixed by removing the h3 element which was not in use or needed.

2. *Warning: Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections.*
- This was fixed by changing the section element to a div, as it was not necessary to start a new section.

##Bugs discovered

###Solved bugs:

1. Bootstrap Framework not working, particularly toggle button unresponsive in Navbar
- Solved by adding Bootstrap script in Body of code.

2. When deployed links between pages not working
- Solved by ammending relative file paths

3. When on small screen size table in Classes page spilling out of div, therefore not responsive.
- Solved by adding *table-layout: fixed* to Style.css

4. When on small screen size contact form spilling out of div, therefore not responsive.
- Solved by wrapping table in a row.
