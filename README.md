Project Goals

Weight Up! is a brand new website for the popular gym in Swansea, South Wales. The name is a play on the phrase “Wait Up” meaning to stay awake until someone arrives or to go more slowly until someone catches up, the light-hearted take on a well known phrase for the gym reflects the fun and friendly atmosphere it boasts.

The gym appeals to fitness experts and bodybuilders alike with its extensive range of equipment and free weights down to the novice gym-goer with its variety of daily classes offered with the no-contract membership at the gym. 
 
The Goal here is to provide a user-friendly, easy and clean-looking website to advertise the gym along with its offers and practices. Prospective and current gym members will visit the site to find information on classes, opening times and locations etc.  The website will have a clear and prominent offer for new members and the ability to contact the gym for membership or any other queries.
