## Features

Each page has a responsive navigation bar with a convenient placing of logo text at the top left, this directs to the home page when clicked. The footer is identical on each page featuring copyright information and linked icons to the gym’s social medias.

All pages feature responsiveness to changing screen sizes ensuring that the website can work effectively and promote the gym to the visitor no matter what device they are using.

### Home

The first notable feature of the Home page is the hero image. It provides impact and gives a great sense of what the gym looks and feels like highlighting the expansive range of equipment present but also showing a modern and clean look, evoking a positive emotional response in the user. The image expands and retracts with changing screen sizes but never looks stretched or pixelated. 

Layered on the hero image is a cover text which instantly captures the attention of the visitor. The text lists concisely important information about the gym. One main feature is a link to the contact page where a potential customer can quickly ask the gym a question regarding membership or anything at all.

A gallery responsive of changing screen sizes (showing 3 images on a small screen up to 9 on a large screen) shows quickly what the gym looks like, what equipment is available and features members at the gym enjoying the facilities there. 

More information is given on the expansive range of equipment and high grade facilities below the gallery in a listing form with icons to promote a positive emotional response in the user.

### About

The About page gives the user information on the quality of the gym, and reassures any potential nervous customers who have never been to a gym that all experiences are welcomed. 

A phone number is displayed which may direct the user to speak to a member of staff at the gym who will use their customer service skills to promote the business to them and gain a new member.

A map is displayed on the lower half of the page which visually shows the location of the gym. It shows that it is in a developed and safe area of the city with plenty of links to transport if needed.

### Classes

The Classes page features a table showing all fitness classes available, a potential customer can be attracted to join by seeing a particular class they are interested in. Current members of the gym can easily locate the Classes page and find the time of their preferred class which is displayed in the table at the top of the page.

A fun section profiling the instructors at the gym is located on the page, here a smiling and approachable image of each instructor is provided to evoke a positive emotional response in the user.
